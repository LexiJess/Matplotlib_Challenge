Analysis of drug trial results using mice as test subjects. Libraries, languages, and platforms used include pandas, MatPlotLib, Jupyter Notebook, and python. 

I started with loading the data from the original csv and cleaning/wrangling it into usable dataframes. From there, you can see that I ran several analyses, teasing out differences in the drug regimens' results, the effects on the mice's tumors. Visualizations done with MatPlotLib to demonstrate these results. 


There is a strong correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume on the Capomulin regimen. This says that the drug is less effective as mouse weights increase. Perhaps the drug dosage should also be increased in relation to totoal body weight. Capomulin and Ramicane both showed notable size reduction in tumor volumes and could be considered as potential effective treatments. Infubinol (the only group with a notable outlier) and Ceftamin both had larger average tumor volumes and perhaps hold less potential as an effective treatment. Capomulin and Ramicane also had more participants than the other drugs. There's no mention of why those two had a larger number of participants. Male and female mice were split about equally across all regimens.
