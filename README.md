Hoooooo boy! Well, we got through this one, didn't we? I struggled hard with this assignment and I'm beginning to think that they are designed that way. Trying to find out to keep the correct data associated with its partner data throughout many manipulations (sorting by individual mice, keeping drug regimens associated with those mice, getting the right columns and rows organized appropriately...you know, Data Science stuff). 

There is a strong correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume on the Capomulin regimen. This says that the drug is less effective as mouse weights increase. Perhaps the drug dosage should also be increased in relation to totoal body weight. 

Capomulin and Ramicane both showed notable size reduction in tumor volumes and could be considered as potential effective treatments. Infubinol (the only group with a notable outlier) and Ceftamin both had larger average tumor volumes and perhaps hold less potential as an effective treatment. 

Capomulin and Ramicane also had more participants than the other drugs. There's no mention of why those two had a larger number of participants. Male and female mice were split about equally across all regimens.
